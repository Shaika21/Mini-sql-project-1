--Write a solution to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users (both client and driver must not be banned) each day between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03". Round Cancellation Rate to two decimal points.

--Return the result table in any order.

-- trim the trips table to have required data.
-- get the total request per day.
-- get the cancelled requests per day.
